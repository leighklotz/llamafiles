The script takes a directory as an argument (optional) and installs the scripts into that directory if provided. If no directory is provided, it may install the scripts into a default location.
- [llava-cli.sh Script for Running LLM Model](llava-cli.sh): This is a Bourne-Again shell script that serves as a command-line interface (CLI) for a language model (LLM) named `llava-v1.5-7b-q4-main`. The script executes the model using the provided file `~klotz/wip/llamafiles/models/llava-v1.5-7b-q4-main.llamafile` with the given arguments (`${*}`).
- [LLM Script](llm.sh): A Bourne-Again shell script for a language model that accepts command-line arguments and environment variables. It sources an `env.sh` file for site-specific variables, if present. The script allows users to specify the model type, input source (stdin, interactive), length of response, temperature, context length, number of predictions, debug mode, verbose mode, grammar file, and question(s) to be answered.
- [Logit Probabilities Printer Script](logit-probs-printer.sh): This is a Bourne-Again shell script that reads a file containing prompts and uses the `jq` tool to convert the content into a JSON object. The JSON object has two keys: `use_sampler` and `prompt`. The script seems to be designed to print logit probabilities based on the content of the prompt file.
- [Mac Help Script](machelp.sh): This is a Bourne-Again shell script designed to answer user questions or follow user instructions about Mac, OSX, Bash, Python, general programming, or other subjects. The script first determines the directory of the current script file, then sets an environment variable `SYSTEM_MESSAGE` with a message for the user. Finally, it executes another script named `llm.sh` with the provided arguments.
- [NV Free Memory Script](nvfree.sh): A Bash script that checks the free GPU memory on a system with NVIDIA GPUs. If the `nvidia-smi` command is available, it queries the free GPU memory in GB and prints it with two decimal places. If `nvidia-smi` is not available, it exits with a status code of 1 and prints "0" as the free memory.
- [rename-pictures.sh](rename-pictures.sh): A Bourne-Again shell script that renames images in a folder to have descriptive English filenames. It is based on the Mistral 7b and LLaVA v1.5 models and is licensed under Apache 2.0. The script aims to improve the naming of images for better organization and understanding. The provided example command demonstrates its usage.
- [Scuttle Script](scuttle.sh): A Bourne-Again shell script that executes a link management operation. The script takes a link as an argument, optionally with the `--json` flag, and uses functions defined in `functions.sh` located in the parent directory of the script's location. The script also includes a `usage` function to display the script's usage instructions.
- [LLava Server Script](server.sh): This is a Bourne-Again shell script that executes the LLava server with version 1.5-7b-q4. The script sets the host to 0.0.0.0 and disables the browser, allowing the server to listen on all available network interfaces.
- [Start Embedding Server Script](start-embedding-server.sh): This is a Bourne-Again shell script that starts an embedding server using a specific model named `ggml-sfr-embedding-mistral-q8_0.gguf`. The script first determines the directory of the current script file using `BASH_SOURCE`, then navigates to the parent directory twice to reach the `models` directory, and finally executes the specified model with the `--server` option to start the server.
- [Summarize Directory Files Script](summarize-directory-files.sh): A Bash script that summarizes the contents of a directory. It determines the script directory, checks for an inhibit grammar flag, and if not set, creates a temporary grammar file for parsing the directory structure.
- [Summarize Script](summarize.sh): This is a Bourne-Again shell script that appears to be designed for summarizing or processing text files. The script sets the `SCRIPT_DIR` variable to the directory of the current script, and defines two variables `LINK` and `ARGS`. It also sources a separate script `functions.sh` located in the parent directory of the current script. The specific functionality of the script is not fully clear from the provided code snippet, but it seems to be intended for processing command-line arguments.
- [Systype Information Script](systype.sh): This is a Bourne-Again shell script that provides information about the system. It displays the system details by executing `uname -a` and `cat /etc/os-release` commands, and filters out URLs from the output of the latter command using `egrep`.
- [Bash Completion Script for Via API](_via_completion.bash): This is a Bash completion script for the Via API. It provides autocompletion for commands such as `--get-model-name`, `--list-models`, and `--list-models-types`. This script is intended to be sourced in a Bash shell to enhance user experience when interacting with the Via API.
- [Admin client for OpenAPI-compatible LLM server (via.sh)](via.sh): This is a Bourne-Again shell script that serves as an administrative client for an OpenAPI-compatible Language Model (LLM) server. It is tested with Oobabooga Text Generation Webui. The script sources environment variables from `env.sh` if it exists, and sets the `VIA` variable to `api` if not provided.
- [write.sh: Bash Script for System-Dependent Commands](write.sh): This Bourne-Again shell script is designed to execute system-dependent commands suitable for copy/pasting into various shells on different operating systems. It first determines the script directory using the `dirname` and `realpath` commands. If the file `/etc/os-release` exists, it checks the operating system and potentially executes system-specific commands. The script seems to be intended for use with a proprietary OpenAI Help feature in iTerm2.
