Introducing the New llm.el Package for Emacs
====================================================

Are you looking for a powerful and flexible way to integrate a command-line language model (LLM) into your Emacs workflow? Look no further than the new `llm.el` package! This package provides a set of functions for interacting with an LLM from within Emacs, allowing you to easily incorporate its capabilities into your editing tasks.

Getting Started
---------------

To use the `llm.el` package, you will need to have an LLM installed and accessible from the command line. You will also need to customize the `llm-rewrite-script-path` variable to point to the script that invokes your LLM.

Once you have set up your LLM and customized the `llm-rewrite-script-path` variable, you can begin using the `llm.el` functions. Here is a brief overview of the main functions provided by the package:

### `llm-write`

The `llm-write` function writes a new buffer based on the prompt and current region, as well as the output of the `llm-rewrite-script-path` command. This function is useful for generating new text based on a given prompt and context.

Here is an example of how to use the `llm-write` function:

```lisp
(llm-write "Write a blog post about Emacs:" (point-min) (point-max))
```

This will create a new buffer containing a blog post about Emacs, using the current buffer as context.

### `llm-summarize-buffer`

The `llm-summarize-buffer` function summarizes the current buffer using the LLM. This function is useful for quickly getting a summary of a large buffer.

Here is an example of how to use the `llm-summarize-buffer` function:

```lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "M-s $") 'llm-summarize-buffer)
```

This will bind the `llm-summarize-buffer` function to the `M-s $` key sequence, allowing you to quickly summarize the current buffer by pressing the key sequence.

### `llm-rewrite`

The `llm-rewrite` function rewrites the current region using the LLM. This function is useful for revising or expanding text within the current buffer.

Here is an example of how to use the `llm-rewrite` function:

```lisp
(llm-rewrite)
```

This will rewrite the current region using the LLM, replacing the region with the LLM's output.

Conclusion
----------

The `llm.el` package provides a powerful and flexible way to integrate an LLM into your Emacs workflow. With its set of functions for interacting with an LLM, you can easily incorporate its capabilities into your editing tasks. Whether you want to generate new text, summarize a buffer, or revise existing text, the `llm.el` package has you covered. So why wait? Give it a try today!
