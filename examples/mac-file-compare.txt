$ machelp give a bash cli to find lines in file A that are not in file B and the files are not sorted
A classic problem!

To find lines in file A that are not in file B, even if the files are not sorted, you can use the following Bash command:
```bash
comm -13 <(sort fileA) <(sort fileB)
```
Here's how it works:

* `comm` is a command that compares two files line by line.
* The `-1` option tells `comm` to print only the lines that are not common to both files.
* The `-3` option tells `comm` to print only the lines that are not found in either file.
* The `<( )` syntax is called process substitution, which allows you to treat the output of a command as a file.
* `sort` is used to sort the files before comparing them. This ensures that the comparison is case-sensitive and considers only the line order.

To use this command, replace `fileA` and `fileB` with the actual paths to your files.

Example:
```bash
comm -13 <(sort example1.txt) <(sort example2.txt)
```
This will print the lines that are unique to `example1.txt` and not found in `example2.txt`.

If you want to write the output to a new file, you can redirect the output to a file:
```bash
comm -13 <(sort fileA) <(sort fileB) > output.txt
```
Note that the `comm` command assumes that the files are in the same encoding (e.g., both are UTF-8). If the files have different encodings, you may need to use a different approach.
