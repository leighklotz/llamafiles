1. **Understand the Output:**
   - Your system has no packages to upgrade at the moment. The packages listed under "The following packages have been kept back:" are not being upgraded because they are in a transitional state or there's an issue preventing their upgrade.

2. **Troubleshooting Steps:**

   - **Check for Held Packages:**
     You can check which packages are held (kept back) with:
     ```
     sudo apt-mark showhold
     ```
     If any packages are listed, they might be preventing other upgrades. You can unhold them with:
     ```
     sudo apt-mark unhold <package_name>
     ```

   - **Update and Upgrade Again:**
     After unholding any packages, try updating and upgrading again:
     ```
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt upgrade
          ```

   - **Check for Dependency Issues:**
     If you still have held packages or the upgrade process is failing, there might be dependency issues. You can check for broken dependencies with:
     ```
     sudo apt install -f
     ```
     This command attempts to fix broken dependencies automatically.

   - **Check for Transitional Packages:**
     Some packages might be kept back because they are transitional packages introduced during the upgrade process. You can check for these with:
     ```
     sudo apt-mark showtrans
     ```
     If transitional packages are listed, you might need to force their upgrade or remove them manually.

3. **Manually Upgrade Kept-Back Packages:**
   If you want to upgrade the kept-back packages manually, you can do so with:
   ```
   sudo apt upgrade <package_name>
   ```
   Replace `<package_name>` with the name of the package you want to upgrade.

4. **Clean Up:**
   After upgrading, remember to clean up any unused packages with:
   ```
   sudo apt autoremove
   ```
