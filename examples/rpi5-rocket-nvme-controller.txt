klotz@rpi5:~ $ help.sh how can i find out what controller is used on an nvme drive
To find out which controller is used for an NVMe drive in Linux, you can use the command `lspci` to list all the PCI devices on your system. Look for the line that starts with '01:00' or '00:01', which represents the NVMe drives. The controller information will be displayed in the next line, typically starting with 'Vendor' and 'Product'. 

Here's an example:

```bash
$ lspci
01:00.0 PCIe: NVIDIA Corporation GP106-QD16 (rev a1)
device 0: 2: 0: 0
vendor 0x10de vendor 0x0de
01:00.1 PCIe: NVIDIA Corporation GP106-QD16 (rev a1)
device 1: 2: 0: 1
vendor 0x10de vendor 0x0de
```

In this example, the NVMe drives are identified by their PCI addresses (01:00.0 and 01:00.1). The first line of the corresponding PCI device shows the vendor and product ID, which can be used to identify the controller.

Please note that the specific command and output may vary depending on your Linux distribution and the hardware you're using.
