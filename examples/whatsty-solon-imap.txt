klotz@tensor:~$ whatsty solon | help.sh what happened to these two classification jobs overnight


Okay, I've analyzed the logs. It appears two classification jobs ran overnight, both successfully labeled and classified. One message (UID 477320) was correctly identified as a `LINUX_ALERTS` notification – specifically a cron job indicating a successful MySQL backup. The other (UID 267176) was correctly categorized as `PROMOTIONS`, an email advertising ebooks from IOP Publishing.

However, there's a recurring issue with the IMAP connection. The logs show repeated `ssl.SSLEOFError: EOF occurred in violation of protocol` errors, leading to the connection being closed and a traceback occurring during the `idle` process. This is happening in both "solon" and "solon-1" processes. The error suggests a problem with the SSL/TLS connection to the email server – it could be due to network instability, server-side issues, or a configuration problem with the SSL/TLS settings in your `solon.py` script.

The error during logout and connection closure, combined with the consistent IDLE timeouts, strongly indicate a persistent network or server-side communication problem that needs investigating. The repeated attempts to `IDLE` suggest `solon` is trying to maintain a persistent connection but failing. It's good that the classification itself *is* working, but the connection issues will prevent continuous monitoring.
