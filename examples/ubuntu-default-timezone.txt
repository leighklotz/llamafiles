$ systype | help.sh how do I set default timezone to San Francisco on this ubuntu system via cli
You can set the timezone by using the `timedatectl` command. Here's how you can set the timezone to America/Los_Angeles which is San Francisco's timezone:
```bash
sudo timedatectl set-timezone America/Los_Angeles
```

You can also use the `tzselect` command which lets you select the desired timezone by selecting the region and city:
```bash
sudo tzselect
```
For America, select 5 for New York (which is in the same timezone as San Francisco). This will update the timezone in the system. 

After setting the timezone, the system files will be updated, but you might need to reboot the system for some applications to pick up the changes.

You can set the default timezone on your Ubuntu system via CLI by using the `timedatectl` command, which is a utility for controlling the system time and date on Linux.

To see the current system timezone, you can run:
```bash
timedatectl
```
This should output the current date, time, and timezone.

To change the timezone, you can run the following command, replacing 'Europe/London' with your desired timezone:
```bash
timedatectl set-timezone 'Europe/London'
```
Here are some example timezones you can use:
- 'America/New_York'
- 'Europe/London'
- 'Asia/Tokyo'

You can replace the zone with the desired location and it will update the system timezone accordingly.
