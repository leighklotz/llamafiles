This issue is related to the public key used for signature verification of the packages from the Google Chrome repository. You can fix this by importing the missing GPG key for the Google Chrome repository. Here are the steps to do that:

1. Open a terminal and run the following command to import the missing GPG key:

```bash
wget -q -O - https://dl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub | sudo apt-key add -
```

2. After importing the GPG key, you need to update the package list again. Run the following command to do that:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

Now, the issue should be resolved, and you can proceed with installing or upgrading the packages without any issues.

If you still face any problems or errors, please let me know, and I will be happy to help you.
