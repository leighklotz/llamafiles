$ man xxd | help.sh "I want to print the file contents with xxd, without the address column. Here is the man page."
 To print the file contents with `xxd` without the address column, you can use the `-ps` or `-plain` option. This will display the hex dump in plain style without line numbers or column labels. Here's the example:

```bash
xxd -ps file > output.hex
```

This command will read the contents of `file` and write the hex dump in plain style to `output.hex`.
