help explain the options in "git log --oneline --graph --decorate grammar-fixes..main"
The command git log --oneline --graph --decorate grammar-fixes..main is used to display a graphically-enhanced log of commits with a focus on the 'grammar-fixes' branch and the 'main' branch. Here's an explanation of each option:

-oneline: This option displays each commit as a single line, containing the commit hash, author, date, and a brief description of the changes.

--graph: This option adds a ASCII graph of branch and merge relationships to the output. It helps visualize the commit graph.

--decorate: This option includes branch and tag names on the commit lines, providing easier navigation between commits.

grammar-fixes..main: This is a special syntax in git to show commits that are in the specified branch (grammar-fixes) but not in the second specified branch (main). It shows the changes made in the 'grammar-fixes' branch that have not been merged into the 'main' branch.

Please note that after running this command, you will probably see that the commits in 'grammar-fixes' have not been merged into 'main'. This might be intentional because you are working on a feature branch that needs to be reviewed or tested before being merged.
