Okay, let's break down the memory bandwidth for this system. Based on the provided `lshw` output, we have the following key details:

*   **Total RAM:** 64GiB
*   **RAM Configuration:** Two 32GiB SODIMM DDR4 modules*   **RAM Speed:** 3200 MHz (0.3 ns latency)
*   **RAM Width:** 64 bits (per module)

DDR4 (Double Data Rate 4) effectively transfers data twice per clock cycle.  Therefore, the effective data rate is 3200 MHz * 2 = 6400 MT/s (MegaTransfers per second).

The width of the memory bus is 64 bits, which translates to 8 bytes (64 / 8 = 8).

To calculate the theoretical peak memory bandwidth, we multiply the data rate by the bus width:

6400 MT/s * 8 bytes/transfer = 51,200 MB/s

Converting to GB/s:

51,200 MB/s / 1024 MB/GB = 50 GB/s

**Therefore, the theoretical peak memory bandwidth of this system is approximately 50 GB/s.**

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Dual-Channel:** The presence of two modules suggests dual-channel memory is enabled, effectively doubling the bandwidth compared to a single module. If dual-channel wasn't functioning, the bandwidth would be halved to 25 GB/s.
*   **Real-World Bandwidth:** The calculated value is *theoretical*. Actual sustained bandwidth will be lower due to factors like CPU memory controller limitations, chipset overhead, and memory timings.
*   **CPU Memory Controller:** The Intel Core i9-10980HK CPU supports DDR4-2933, meaning while the RAM is capable of 3200MHz, the CPU might limit it to 2933MHz, reducing the bandwidth. However, the system report indicates 3200MHz operation, so this doesn't appear to be a limitation in this instance.
