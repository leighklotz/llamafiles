Okay, let's break down the memory bandwidth for this system. Based on the provided `lshw` output, we have the following key details:

*   **Total RAM:** 64GiB
*   **RAM Configuration:** Two 32GiB SODIMM DDR4 modules*   **RAM Speed:** 3200 MHz (0.3 ns latency)
*   **RAM Width:** 64 bits (per module)

DDR4 (Double Data Rate 4) effectively transfers data twice per clock cycle.  Therefore, the effective data rate is 3200 MHz * 2 = 6400 MT/s (MegaTransfers per second).

The width of the memory bus is 64 bits, which translates to 8 bytes (64 / 8 = 8).

To calculate the theoretical peak memory bandwidth, we multiply the data rate by the bus width:

6400 MT/s * 8 bytes/transfer = 51,200 MB/s

Converting to GB/s:

51,200 MB/s / 1024 MB/GB = 50 GB/s

**Therefore, the theoretical peak memory bandwidth of this system is approximately 50 GB/s.**

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Dual-Channel:** The presence of two modules suggests dual-channel memory is enabled, effectively doubling the bandwidth compared to a single module. If dual-channel wasn't functioning, the bandwidth would be halved to 25 GB/s.
*   **Real-World Bandwidth:** The calculated value is *theoretical*. Actual sustained bandwidth will be lower due to factors like CPU memory controller limitations, chipset overhead, and memory timings.
*   **CPU Memory Controller:** The Intel Core i9-10980HK CPU supports DDR4-2933, meaning while the RAM is capable of 3200MHz, the CPU might limit it to 2933MHz, reducing the bandwidth. However, the system report indicates 3200MHz operation, so this doesn't appear to be a limitation in this instance.

Based on the system information provided, calculating memory bandwidth requires knowing the memory configuration and timings. You have 64GiB of RAM consisting of two 32GiB DDR4 modules running at 3600MHz with a 64-bit width.

Here's how we calculate the theoretical peak memory bandwidth:

*   **Data Rate:** 3600 MHz (Megahertz) which translates to 3600 million transfers per second.  DDR (Double Data Rate) means 2 transfers per clock cycle. So, the effective data rate is 3600 * 2 = 7200 MT/s (MegaTransfers per second).
*   **Bus Width:** 64 bits (8 bytes).
*   **Number of Channels:** The presence of two DIMMs suggests a dual-channel configuration.

Therefore, the calculation is:

7200 MT/s * 8 bytes/transfer * 2 channels = 115,200 MB/s
Converting to GB/s:

115,200 MB/s / 1024 MB/GB ≈ **112.5 GB/s**

So, the theoretical peak memory bandwidth for your system is approximately **112.5 GB/s**.  It’s important to remember this is *peak* bandwidth. Actual bandwidth achieved in real-world applications will be lower due to various factors like memory timings, CPU memory controller limitations, and system overhead.
