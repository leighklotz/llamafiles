 Commit Message:

Refactor script to find first existing executable or GGUF in the list using find_first_model function.

Changes:
- Replaced find_first_file function with find_first_model function.
- Changed the logic in find_first_model function to check for executable files and GGUFs.

Functional Changes:
- Improved script flexibility by allowing the use of GGUFs in addition to executable files.
- Simplified the code by merging the logic for finding executable files and GGUFs into a single function.
