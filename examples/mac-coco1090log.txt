The file COCOA1090LOG.TXT appears to be a log file related to aviation, specifically, it seems to contain flight logs for various aircraft. Each line in the file represents a flight and contains the following information:

1. Date and time of the flight's start and end.
2. A unique identifier (hexadecimal) for the flight.
3. A tail number (hexadecimal), which is a unique identifier for the aircraft.
4. Another tail number (hexadecimal), which seems to be a duplicate of the previous one.
5. A three-letter code representing the aircraft model.
6. A four-letter code representing the aircraft type.
7. A numerical value, possibly representing the flight's duration or another related metric.

Here are a few examples of the data from the log file, along with possible interpretations:
