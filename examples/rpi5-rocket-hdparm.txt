Based on the provided information, it seems that you are using a Raspberry Pi 5 (rpi5) with an NVMe drive (nvme0n1) installed. The hdparm command output indicates that the disk is performing well with a read speed of 756.74 MB/sec.

As for the question about NVMe drive performance on rpi5 with pcie_x1 gen=3, it's important to note that the Raspberry Pi 5 has a PCIe 4.0 x8 slot, which supports NVMe drives. However, the pcie_x1 gen=3 is a PCIe 1.x interface, which is significantly slower compared to PCIe 4.0.

NVMe drives are optimized for high-speed data transfer and are designed to take full advantage of PCIe 4.0 interfaces. Therefore, it's unlikely that you would achieve the same high performance with a pcie_x1 gen=3 interface.

However, it's worth noting that the Raspberry Pi 5 is a general-purpose computer, and it's possible to run a Linux distribution (such as Debian) on it. The provided uname and os-release outputs indicate that you are running Debian on your Raspberry Pi 5.

In conclusion, while it's possible to use an NVMe drive on a Raspberry Pi 5, the performance may not be as high as it could be due to the slower pcie_x1 gen=3 interface. The provided hdparm output indicates thatthe NVMe drive is performing well, but it's important to consider the limitations of the pcie_x1 gen=3 interface when evaluating its performance.
