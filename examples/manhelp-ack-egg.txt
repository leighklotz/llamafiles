$ manhelp ack -- 'list easter eggs'
That's the man page for the `ack` command-line tool, which is a popular grep alternative.  

It looks like you're asking for easter eggs, which are hidden features or jokes often found in software.

Looking through the `ack` man page, here are the easter eggs I found:

* **--thpppt**: This option is a reference to the comic strip character, "Bill the Cat," who is known for saying "Thpppt!"

* **--bar**: This option references a humorous internet meme about a warning admiral.

* **--cathy**: This option simply prints "Chocolate! Chocolate! Chocolate!" repeatedly.



Let me know if you'd like me to explain any of the `ack` options in more detail!
