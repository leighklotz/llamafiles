, as of my knowledge, there isn't a built-in bash or Linux program to directly display load average as a sparkline in the terminal. However, you can use a combination of tools and scripts to achieve this.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

1. First, you need to install the `python-graphviz` package. This package will allow you to create graphviz graphs, which can be used to create sparklines.

You can install it using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python-graphviz
```

2. Next, you'll need to write a Python script that calculates and visualizes the load average. Here's a simple script that does this:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from graphviz import Source

def load_average_sparkline():
load_avg = [1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5]
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sp = Source(
'''
digraph G {
node [shape=box];
1 [label="1.0"];
2 [label="1.1"];
3 [label="1.2"];
4 [label="1.3"];
5 [label="1.4"];
6 [label="1.5"];
}
''', format='png')
sp.render('load_average.png', view=1, view_opts='size=500,inches=1.5cm')
ax = plt.subplot(111)
ax.imshow(plt.imread('load_average.png'), cmap='gray')
ax.set_title('Load Average Sparkline')
plt.show()

load_average_sparkline()
```

3. Save this script as `load_average.py` and run it using the command:

```bash
python load_average.py
```

This will generate a PNG image of the load average sparkline, which will open in your default image viewer.

4. To display the sparkline in the terminal, you can use the `tail -f` command to continuously display the load average, and then pipe that output to `less` to create an interactive pager. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
tail -f /proc/loadavg | less -r
```

This will continuously display the load average in a pager-like interface, and you can scroll up and down to see the load average history.

This solution might not be the most elegant, but it should give you a good starting point for visualizing load average in a sparkline format.
