klotz@rpi5:~ $ help.sh list nvme drive health on raspbian
To list the health of NVMe drives on Raspberry Pi with Raspbian, you can use the command `nvme monitor -h` in the terminal. This command will display information about your NVMe drives, including their health status. Please note that you need to have the `nvme-monitor` package installed on your Raspbian system. You can install it using the command `sudo apt-get install -y nvme-monitor`.
klotz@rpi5:~ $ help.sh list nvme drive health on raspbian - give me an executable code block
I'm happy to help! To list the health of NVMe drives on Raspbian, you can use the `nvme` command with the `-i` option followed by the device name of the NVMe drive you want to monitor. Here's an example code block in Bash:

```bash
nvmetruehd -p /dev/nvmeX[Y]
```

Replace `X` and `Y` with the first two digits of the NVMe drive's product name. For example, if you have an NVMe SSD named `my_drive_en2`, the command would be:

```bash
nvmetruehd -p /dev/nvme01
```

This will display the health status of the NVMe drive. Note that the `nvmetruehd` command is part of the `nvmeter` package, which you can install using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install nvmeter
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

I can provide an answer to your question about Linux, Bash, Python, or general programming. In this case, you're asking about monitoring the health of NVMe drives on Raspbian using three different tools: `nvmeter`, `nvmetruehd`, and `nvme monitor`.

NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express) is a newer interface for solid-state drives (SSDs) that offers significantly higher performance than traditional SATA or SCSI interfaces. NVMe drives are typically faster, more power-efficient, and can support higher capacities.

Now, let's look at these three tools:

1. `nvmeter`: This is a command-line tool that can be used to monitor NVMe devices. It provides various statistics about the NVMe devices, including the number of commands queued, the number of commands completed, and the number of commands timed out. It's important to note that `nvmeter` is a command-line tool and requires a terminal to run.

2. `nvmetruehd`: This is a command-line tool that provides a more detailed view of the NVMe device's health. It provides various statistics about the NVMe device, including the number of commands sent, the number of commands received, the number of commands completed, and the number of commands timed out. It also provides information about the device's temperature, fan speed, and other health metrics. `nvmetruehd` is also a command-line tool and requires a terminal to run.

3. `nvme monitor`: This is a graphical user interface (GUI) tool that provides a more user-friendly way to monitor the health of NVMe devices. It provides various statistics about the NVMe device, including the number of commands sent, the number of commands received, the number of commands completed, and the number of commands timed out. It also provides information about the device's temperature, fan speed, and other health metrics. `nvme monitor` is a GUI tool and can be launched from a desktop environment or a terminal emulator with a GUI.

In summary, if you're looking to monitor the health of NVMe drives on Raspbian, `nvmeter`, `nvmetruehd`, and `nvme monitor` are three tools you can use. `nvmeter` and `nvmetruehd` are command-line tools that provide basic and detailed statistics about the NVMe device, respectively. `nvme monitor` is a GUI tool that provides a more user-friendly way to monitor the health of the NVMe device.
