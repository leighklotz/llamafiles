klotz@tensor:~/wip/solon$ nvidia-smi |help.sh explain
Okay, let's break down what this `nvidia-smi` output is telling us. This is a snapshot of your NVIDIA GPU's status as of May 2nd, 2025. Here’s a detailed explanation:

*   **`NVIDIA-SMI 560.35.05`**:  This indicates you're using NVIDIA System Management Interface version 560.35.05. This is the tool used to query and manage NVIDIA GPUs.
*   **`Driver Version: 560.35.05` & `CUDA Version: 12.6`**: These are the versions of the NVIDIA driver and the CUDA toolkit installed on your system. CUDA is NVIDIA’s parallel computing platform and API. Version 12.6 suggests you have a relatively recent CUDA installation.
*   **GPU Information (Row 0)**:
    *   **`Name: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090`**: You have an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU, a high-end graphics card.
    *   **`Persistence-M: Off`**:  GPU persistence mode is disabled. When enabled, the driver keeps the GPU context loaded even when no applications are actively using it, potentially reducing overhead when relaunching applications.
    *   **`Bus-Id: 0000:00:00.0`**: This is the PCI bus ID of your GPU – it’s a unique identifier for the card within your system.
    *   **`Disp.A: Off`**: Display output is currently disabled on this GPU.
    *   **`Volatile Uncorr. ECC: N/A`**:  Error correction code (ECC) isn't being monitored, or isn't applicable to this GPU configuration.  RTX 3090s don’t typically have ECC enabled by default.
*   **GPU Usage (Row 0 - continued)**:
    *   **`Fan: 30%`**:  The GPU fan is running at 30% speed.
    *   **`Temp: 39C`**: The GPU temperature is 39 degrees Celsius. This is a very cool temperature, indicating good cooling.
    *   **`Perf: P8`**: Performance state is set to P8. The power limit appears to be controlling the performance.
    *   **`Pwr:Usage/Cap: 19W / 350W`**: The GPU is currently using 19 Watts of power out of a maximum capacity of 350 Watts.  Very low power draw, suggesting low activity.
    *   **`Memory-Usage: 23876MiB / 24576MiB`**:  The GPU is using 23876 MiB of its 24576 MiB total memory.  Almost fully utilized.
    *   **`GPU-Util: 0%`**:  The GPU is currently not performing any computations (0% utilization).
    *   **`Compute M.: Default`**: The compute mode is set to the default configuration.
    *   **`MIG M.: N/A`**: Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) isn't being used. MIG allows you to partition the GPU into smaller, isolated instances.
*   **Processes Section**:
    *   **`PID: 3952`**: Process ID 3952 is using the GPU.
    *   **`Type: C`**: The process is a CUDA application.
    *   **`Process name: ...llama_cpp_binaries/bin/llama-server`**:  The process is `llama-server`, which is a part of the `llama.cpp` project. This indicates you are running a large language model (LLM) inference server.
    *   **`GPU Memory Usage: 23866MiB`**: This process is consuming 23866 MiB of GPU memory. This confirms `llama-server` is the primary user of the GPU.  The memory usage closely matches the overall GPU memory usage.

**In summary:** You have an RTX 3090 GPU that is currently running `llama-server`, a program used for running LLMs. The GPU is almost fully utilizing its memory, but is currently idle in terms of compute (0% GPU utilization) and is consuming minimal power. The fan is running at a low speed, keeping the temperature very cool.  It appears the LLM is loaded into memory, ready to serve requests, but isn't actively processing anything at this moment.

Do you want me to elaborate on any specific aspect, like the `llama.cpp` project, CUDA, or perhaps how to monitor the GPU utilization over time?
