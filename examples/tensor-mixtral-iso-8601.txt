 ISO 8601 and RFC 3339 are both standardized date and time formats, and they are very similar, but there are some differences between them.

ISO 8601 is an international standard covering the exchange of date and time-related data, produced by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). It was issued in 1988 and last updated in 2019.

RFC 3339 is a standard for the format of date and time in Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) protocols, based on ISO 8601. It was issued in 2002 and last updated in 2011.

The main differences between the two formats are:

1. Timezone representation:
	* In ISO 8601, the timezone can be represented using the format "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ", where "Z" indicates Zulu time, which is equivalent to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
	* In RFC 3339, the timezone can be represented using the format "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss+HH:MM" or "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss-HH:MM", where "HH:MM" indicates the timezone offset from UTC.
2. Fractional seconds:
	* In ISO 8601, fractional seconds can be represented using the format "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sss", where "sss" indicates the fractional seconds with up to 3 digits.
	* In RFC 3339, fractional seconds can be represented using the format "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.ssssss", where "ssssss" indicates the fractional seconds with up to 6 digits.

In general, RFC 3339 is a subset of ISO 8601, which means that any RFC 3339 date and time string is also a valid ISO 8601 date and time string. However, the reverse is not true, as not all ISO 8601 date and time strings are valid RFC 3339 date and time strings.
