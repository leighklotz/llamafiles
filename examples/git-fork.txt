$ bashblock git remote -v | help.sh "rename origin to old-origin and add a new origin that is git@github:leighklotz/llamafile"
 To rename the existing origin to "old-origin" and add a new origin with the URL `git@github.com:leighklotz/llamafile`, you can use the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Rename existing origin to old-origin
$ git remote rename origin old-origin

# Add new origin with the given URL
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:leighklotz/llamafile

# Verify the new remote has been added and the old origin has been renamed
$ git remote -v
```

After executing these commands, the output of `git remote -v` should look like:

```bash
origin	git@github.com:leighklotz/llamafile.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:leighklotz/llamafile.git (push)
old-origin	https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile.git (fetch)
old-origin	https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile.git (push)
```

This indicates that you have successfully renamed the existing origin to `old-origin` and added a new origin with the given URL.
