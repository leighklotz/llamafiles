klotz@tensor:~$ whatsty solon | help.sh 'What is going on in this Linux `screen`'
Based on the output you've provided, it looks like you have a Linux `screen` session running with two main processes or tasks: `solon` and `text-generation-webui`. Here's a breakdown of what's happening:

1. **`solon` Process:**
   - The `solon` process appears to be a script or application running from the `/home/klotz/wip/solon/./solon.py` file.
   - It has fetched 0 messages and is looking at the last 100 messages.
   - It has logged several INFO messages indicating its actions, such as disconnecting, ending labels processing, and sleeping for a specified loop delay.
   - The process seems to be configured with `self.args.max_age=0`, `self.args.reclassify=False`, and `self.args.folder_name='1Inbox'`.

2. **Performance Metrics for `solon`:**
   - There are performance metrics for the `llama` model, which includes load time, prompt evaluation time, total evaluation time, and tokens per second.
   - The output generated in 4.34 seconds with a token generation rate of 39.63 tokens per second.

3. **`text-generation-webui` Process:**
   - The `text-generation-webui` process is another script or application running.
   - It has a mark set, indicating it might be at a specific point in the process or code.

4. **General Information:**
   - The `screen` session is running in a shell and has two windows: one named `*solon-1*` and another named `*text-generation-webui*`.
   - The load average (LA) for the system is 0.04, 0.06, and 0.05 over the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes, respectively.

Overall, it seems like you are running two processes related to text generation and processing in a `screen` session, with detailed logs and performance metrics being outputted. If you need more specific information or help with any particular aspect, feel free to ask!

Based on the provided output, here's what's happening in your Linux `screen` session:

1. **GPU Information**:
   - You're using an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU.
   - The GPU is running at 0MHz (which might be an idle state or throttling).
   - The memory is running at 405MHz.
   - The GPU temperature is 38Â°C.
   - The fan speed is at 30%.
   - Power usage is 20W out of a maximum of 350W.
   - GPU utilization is 0%.
   - Memory utilization is approximately 88% (21.234GiB out of 24.000GiB).

2. **Process Information**:
   - There's a single process running with PID 53339, owned by user `klotz`.
   - The process is running a Python script (`server.py`) with specific flags (`--listen --api --tensorc`).
   - The process is using 87% of the GPU memory, 87% of the CPU, and 2249MiB of host memory.

3. **Monitoring Display**:
   - The display shows GPU utilization and memory usage over time, with the last data points being 50s, 37s, 25s, 12s, and 0s ago.
   - It also shows a summary of the processes running on the GPU.

4. **Screen Functions**:
   - The `screen` session offers various functions via function keys, such as setup (F2), sort (F6), kill (F9), quit (F10), and save config (F12).

This output suggests that the `screen` session is monitoring GPU activity and is running a Python process that is utilizing significant GPU resources.
