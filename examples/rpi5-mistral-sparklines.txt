 There isn't a built-in Bash or Linux program to display load average as a sparkline directly in the terminal. Sparklines are a type of data visualization that is typically used to represent trends over time, and they are not a standard feature of Linux command-line tools.

However, you can create a custom solution using a combination of tools. For example, you can use `awk` to extract load average data from `/proc/loadavg` and `gnuplot` to generate the sparkline. Here's an example command:

```bash
awk 'BEGIN{print "#load\t1\t2\t3\t5\t15"} /proc/sys/vm/loadavg/{print $1 "\t" $3 "\t" $4 "\t" $5 "\t" $6 "\t" $7}' /proc/sys/vm/loadavg | gnuplot -p loadavg.plt
```

This command will print a load average sparkline to the terminal. The `awk` command extracts the load average values from `/proc/sys/vm/loadavg` and formats them as a table with headers. The `gnuplot` command reads the table and generates the sparkline based on the configuration in the `loadavg.plt` file.

To create the `loadavg.plt` file, you can use the following template:

```
set title "Load Average Sparkline"
set xlabel "Time (s)"
set ylabel "Load Average"
set style data "splines"
set style line 1 pt 1 lc rgb "blue"
set style line 2 pt 1 lc rgb "red"
set style line 3 pt 1 lc rgb "green"
set style line 4 pt 1 lc rgb "black"
set style line 5 pt 1 lc rgb "cyan"
set xtics 1
set ytics 0.2
set xdata time
set timefmt "%s"
set format x "%H:%M:%S"
plot "<awk 'BEGIN{print \"\\t\"; FS=\"\\t\";} /load/{print \$1,\$2,\$3,\$4,\$5,\$6}' loadavg.txt" using 1:2:3:4:5:6 with lines title "1min" lc rgb "blue", \
     "<awk 'BEGIN{print \"\\t\"; FS=\"\\t\";} /load/{print \$1,\$2,\$3,\$4,\$5,\$6}' loadavg.txt" using 1:3:4:5:6:7 with lines title "5min" lc rgb "red", \
     "<awk 'BEGIN{print \"\\t\"; FS=\"\\t\";} /load/{print \$1,\$2,\$3,\$4,\$5,\$6}' loadavg.txt" using 1:4:5:6:7:8 with lines title "15min" lc rgb "green"
```

Save this file as `loadavg.plt` and run the `awk` and `gnuplot` command above to generate the load average sparkline in the terminal.
