~$ help how do I show a bash function definition using declare
To show the definition of a bash function using the `declare` command, you can use the `-f` option with the `declare` command. The `-f` option tells `declare` to display function definitions.

Here is how you can do it:

```bash
declare -f function_name
```

Replace `function_name` with the name of the function you want to see the definition of.

For example, if you have a function called `myFunction`, you would run:

```bash
declare -f myFunction
```

This command will print the definition of `myFunction` to the terminal.

If you want to see the definition of all defined functions in your current shell, you can simply use:

```bash
declare -f
```

This will list all functions and their definitions.
