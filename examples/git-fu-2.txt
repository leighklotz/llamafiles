This error occurs when you are trying to pull changes from a remote repository, but your local branch has commits that the remote branch does not have. To resolve this issue, you can either merge the remote branch into your local branch or reset your local branch to match the remote branch.

To merge the remote branch into your local branch, use the following command:

```
git merge origin/main
```

To reset your local branch to match the remote branch, use the following command:

```
git reset --hard origin/main
```

Please note that using `git reset --hard` will discard any local changes you have made that have not been committed, so use it with caution. 

If you are unsure which option to choose, merging is generally safer as it will preserve your local changes and create a merge commit. However, if you are confident that your local changes are not needed or you want to completely overwrite your local branch with the remote branch, you can use `git reset --hard`. klotz@tensor:~/wip/llamafiles$
