To enable ANSI colors in the input, you can use the `--color` or `-D` options in your command line interface. These options change the color of different parts of the displayed text. 

The `--color` option works as follows:
- `-Dxcolor` or `--color=xcolor`: This changes the color of different parts of the displayed text. `x` is a single character that selects the type of text whose color is being set.
- Uppercase letters can be used only when the `--use-color` option is enabled. When text color is specified by both an uppercase letter and a lowercase letter, the uppercase letter takes precedence.
- A lowercase letter may be followed by a + to indicate that both the normal format change and the specified color should be used.
- Color is either a 4-bit color string or an 8-bit color string.

Here's an example of how to use the `--color` option:
```
$ less -R file.txt --color=Dngk
```
In this example, `Dngk` is the color string, and `file.txt` is the file you want to view with ANSI colors enabled.

Alternatively, you can use the `--use-color` option to enable colored text in various places:
```
$ less -R file.txt --use-color
```

To learn more about ANSI color escape sequences and how to use them, you can set the `LESSANSIENDCHARS` environment variable to a list of characters that can end a color escape sequence. This will prevent less from thinking that characters other than "m" can end an ANSI color escape sequence.

Remember to check if your terminal supports ANSI color escape sequences before enabling them, as not all terminals support these escape sequences.
